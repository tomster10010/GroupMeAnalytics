GroupMeAnalytics
================

Groupme (https://groupme.com/) provides an awesome API (https://dev.groupme.com/docs/v3) that allows users to parse conversations in groups they are a part of.

**What information does it give me about the members in my groups?**  
-Number of messages sent.  
-Total Likes Given.  
-Self Likes. (special rung in hell for people that like their own messages)  
-Total Likes Received.  
-Average Likes Received Per Message.  
-Total Likes Received with Self Likes Subtracted.  (because inflating your numbers isn't cool)  
-Average Likes Received Per Message with Self Likes Subtracted.  
-Total Words Sent.  
-Likes Received from each member and also what percent of the total likes received is from said member.  
-Percent of each member's total likes that went to a particular member.  
-Number of times you liked the same post as another member and what percent of the posts you liked were liked by that same member.  



**How to use it?**  
-Get your groupme API key using your regular account credentials by logging in here: https://dev.groupme.com/session/new  
-Click the shiny orange button "Create Application" and fill out the form. Doesn't matter what you put in these fields, for the callback URL you can simply put in "https://example.com/oauth_callback"  
-After that, go to your application page and you will see your access token  
-Grab python 2.7.x (this app is not compatible with python 3.4.x) from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
-Clone the repo and open the "groupme_analytics.py" file using with your Python IDE of choice. I recommend PyCharm. The Community Edition is free and you can grab that here: http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/  
-Run the app, give your API key when prompted, and watch the magic!
